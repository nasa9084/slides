# Kubernetes

## Do you know "Kubernetes"?

+++

## Kubernetes is...

* A platform for containerized applications
* An abstraction layer of infrastracture
* An autonomous system
  * Self-Healing
  * Automated deployment/rolling out/scaling
* A CNCF project
* abbreviated: k8s

+++

## K8s can manages...

@ol

- K8s manages containerized apps esp. microservices.
- K8s **IS** an microservice app.
- K8s can manages K8s.

## K8s on K8s

- Deploy K8s on K8s
- Overcloud K8s is managed by K8s
- How about undercloud k8s?

Note:
* cf. K8s on K8s on OpenStack

### How to build "self-hosted" K8s

+++

### K8s Components

* kube-apiserver
* kube-scheduler
* kube-controller-manager
* cloud-controller-manager
* etcd
* kubelet
* kube-proxy
* cluster DNS

+++

### How K8s works

### The Level of Self-Hosting

![level of self-hosting](assets/image/level_of_self-hosting.png)

+++

## KEY: static Pod

* Pods managed directly by kubelet
* **WITHOUT** kube-apiserver

``` shell
$ kubelet ----pod-manifest-path=/PATH/TO/MANIFESTS
```

+++

### step 1: prepare nodes

![step-1](assets/image/1.png)

+++

### step 2: bootstrap kubernetes cluster

![step-2](assets/image/2.png)

bootstrap master components are deployed using static Pod

+++

### step 3: deploy Kubernetes on bootstrap cluster

![step-3](assets/image/3.png)

deploy master components using kubectl

+++

### step 4: delete bootstrap cluster
